# Touch

Touch is a lightweight macOS utility that enhances your trackpad experience by providing haptic feedback for various gestures and system events. It runs discreetly in the status bar, offering a simple way to enable or disable haptic feedback and configure it to launch at login.

## Features

- **Haptic Feedback:** Provides distinct haptic patterns for the following actions:
  - **Right-Click:** A subtle double-tap.
  - **Pinch Gesture (Launchpad):** A quick three-tap sequence.
  - **Scrolling:** A gentle tick for each scroll increment.
  - **Mission Control:** A sharp, rising double-tap.
  - **Workspace Change:** A long-short-short pattern.
- **Status Bar Integration:** A simple menu in the status bar allows you to:
  - Enable or disable haptic feedback.
  - Configure the application to launch at login.
  - Quit the application.
